## Chatbot

This project entails building a chatbot leveraging OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model. GPT-3.4 Turbo is an advanced natural language processing model capable of generating human-like text based on the input it receives. By utilizing this model, we can create a conversational interface that interacts with users in a human-like manner.

2. OpenAI GPT-3.4 Turbo: Powered by OpenAI's cutting-edge model, providing high-quality responses.
3. Customizable: The bot can be tailored to specific use cases and trained on specific datasets for improved performance.
4. API Integration: The chatbot can be integrated into various platforms using OpenAI's API, allowing seamless deployment.
